			<!--4-->This HTML file, and the three others were created using Notepad as the text editor. <!--5-->I put in the extra effort to ensure that the coding style of the HTML looked easy to read by using proper tab counts.

			<!--8-->This sentence is the 8th one for paragraph 1 as per the requirement, and is commented as so.
